# I-Common
Make your code more reusable!

## What is it?
It's a free software available from SAtelier that provides a solution for the html code reuse, requiring only a .html file and a .js file.

## How does it works?

The i-common was created to make HTML Reusable in as many HTML pages as you want.

Throughout the i-common.js importation in the HTML file, you can add the code you want to reuse as many times as you want and in many HTML files, you need.

## How do I use this?

### Step 1:
Clone or download the repository i-common.
- In the repository it will have the i-common.js file and a folder with i-common using examples.
- Cut or copy the i-common.js file to the same folder where the HTML you'll be using is.

## How to Set The HTML That You'll Be Reusing

1. Open the i-common.js file and go to `// 'Global' Sections` (line 9);

##**REMEMBER**
- Create an object inside the object section;
- Each code line needs to be wrapped in simple quotes(' ');
- Each code line needs to end with _plus sign_ (+);
- At the end of the HTML code don't forget to put the _semicolon_ (;);
